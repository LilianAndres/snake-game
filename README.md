<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

I don't really know what to say here. This is a little snake game where you can move a snake on a map. You can choose choose the map on which one you want to play (3 levels of difficulty). Each map has some obstacles that you must dodge if you don't want to lose. Your snake is a little snake, to win some points, you have to make him eat apples that spawned randomly on the map. Don't forget to activate the sound. Have fun !
